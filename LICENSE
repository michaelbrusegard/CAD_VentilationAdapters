By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Public License. To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always Produced Material.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright, including, but not limited to, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

h. Produced Material means the sound recording of a performance or a musical work.

i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

j. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

A. Reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

B. Produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2.

3. The Licensed Material and Adapted Material (including, but not limited to, any incidental, background, or other performances of the Licensed Material that are part of other material) is Licensed Material when being Broadcast or otherwise transmitted.

b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use of the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Material as part of any broadcast or other transmission if the use:

1. falls within any applicable Exceptions and Limitations; or

2. is permitted by the Copyright and Similar Rights applicable to Your use of the Licensed Material without permission from the Licensor.

c. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(b) of the Public License.

d. Downstream recipients.

1. Offerings by the Licensor. Each recipient of the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Material (including, but not limited to, any incidental, background, or other performances of the Licensed Material that are part of other material being broadcast or otherwise transmitted) from the Licensor obtains a royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material, and, where applicable, the Adapted Material, under this Public License.

2. Downstream obligations. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material or Adapted Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material or Adapted Material.

e. No Endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material or Adapted Material is, connected with, sponsored, endorsed, or approved by the Licensor or by the creator of the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Material.

Section 3 – Other Public Licenses, Releases, and Other Agreements.

a. Other Public Licenses. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use of the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Material if such use is permitted by a separate Public License (including, but not limited to, any incidental, background, or other performances of the Licensed Material that are part of other material being broadcast or otherwise transmitted) that grants greater or broader rights.

b. Releases and other agreements. This Public License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use of the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Material if such use is permitted by a release or other agreement, including, but not limited to, a release or other agreement that grants greater or broader rights.

Section 4 – Representations and Warranties.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, the Licensed Material is offered As Is and As Available, and the Licensor makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Liability.

To the fullest extent possible, the Licensor will not be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Material (including, but not limited to, any incidental, background, or other performances of the Licensed Material that are part of other material being broadcast or otherwise transmitted), even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for direct, incidental, or consequential damages, so this exclusion or limitation may not apply to You.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material is terminated under Section 6(a), Your right to use the Licensed Material is reinstated only upon express written consent of the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

d. To the extent the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, this Public License also applies to the reproduction and distribution of the musical work, performance, or sound recording on phonorecords (including, but not limited to, compact discs and digital music files) and other sound recordings regardless of the format or medium.

Section 7 – Interpretation.

a. No waiver. No term or provision of this Public License will be waived, nor will any failure to comply with this Public License be consented to, unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the Licensor.
